My name is Adam with matrix number, U2101735. I am
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling anxious about taking this
subject. This is because I never taking this subject before.
I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will try my best. Wish me luck!!!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did
really well in this course because I have studied really hard.
