        Write a class definition for an abstract class, Vehicle, that contains:
        • a double instance variable, maxSpeed
        • a protected double instance variable, currentSpeed
        • a constructor accepting a double used to initialize the maxSpeed instance variable
        • an abstract method, accelerate, that accepts no parameters and returns nothing.
        • a method getCurrentSpeed that returns the value of currentSpeed
        • a method getMaxSpeed that returns the value of maxSpeed
        • a method pedalToTheMetal, that repeatedly calls accelerate until the speed of the vehicle is equal to maxSpeed. pedalToTheMetal returns nothing.
        Can you create an instance of Vehicle?
