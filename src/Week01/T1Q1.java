        Write the definition of a class Telephone that contains:
        • An instance variable areaCode
        • An instance variable number
        • A static variable numberOfTelephoneObject that keeps track of the number of Telephone objects created
        • A constructor that accepts two arguments used to initialize the two instance variables
        • The accessor and mutator methods for areaCode and number
        • A method makeFullNumber that does not accept any argument, concatenates areaCode and number with a dash in between, and returns the resultant String.
        Write the statements to:
        • Instantiate 5 Telephone objects and store them in an array. Iterate through the array to print the full number of the 5 Telephone objects on the console. Your output should look as below:
        03-79676300
        03-79676301
        03-79676302
