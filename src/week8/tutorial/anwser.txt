1. Describe the main difference between Queue and PriorityQueue

Queue :-
1. Queue is a linear data structure which follows FIFO (First In First Out) order.
2. Queue is open at both end.
3. Queue is used when things don't have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First In First Out order like Breadth First Search.
4. Queue is implemented using Array, Linked List, Stack.

PriorityQueue :-
1. PriorityQueue is a linear data structure which follows FIFO (First In First Out) order.
2. PriorityQueue is open at both end.   
3. PriorityQueue is used when things have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First In First Out order like Dijkstra's Algorithm.
4. PriorityQueue is implemented using Heap.

2. Briefly provide THREE (3) real-life example in using PriorityQueue.

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Search Algorithm
3. Prim's Algorithm
